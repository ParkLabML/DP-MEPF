# Differentially Private Mean Embeddings with Perceptual Features (DP-MEPF) 
  



This is the code for the paper **Pre-trained Perceptual Features Improve Differentially Private Image Generation** by Frederik Harder, Milad Jalali, Danica J. Sutherland and Mijung Park, published in TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=R6W7zkMz0P).



The code is based on the implementation for Generative Feature Matching Networks (https://github.com/IBM/gfmn), adapted for python 3 and Pytorch 1.10.
